In Natural Language Processing (NLP), several machine learning methods are employed 
to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Some of the main methods include

**Sentiment Analysis**
**Toxicity Classification**
**Machine translation**
**Named entity recognition:**
*NORP Nationality, Origin, Religon,Person
Cardinal Number like 5,4,3
ordinal position like 1st, 2nd
GPE Geopolitical Entity,Date,Org*

**Spam detection**
**Grammatical error correction**
**Topic modeling: used to summarise the topic**
**Text generation**
**Information retrieval**
*Information Retrieveal is problm that all LLMs face to fetch the data from a million records and to
keep track of multimodal inputs**
