# 🧠 Technical Scope Breakdown

### 1. **Codebase Selection**
- Use the [`SakilaProject`](https://github.com/janjakovacevic/SakilaProject)
- It's a **Spring Boot project** using Java, JPA, MVC, and Thymeleaf

### 2. **Code Parsing and Chunking**
- Traverse all `.java` files
- Split content **into chunks that do not exceed token limits** (e.g., 3000 tokens)
- Include filename metadata per chunk

### 3. **LLM Integration**
- Feed each chunk to an LLM (e.g., `gpt-4-0125-preview`)
- Prompt should ask the LLM to:
  - Give a high-level **overview** of functionality
  - Extract **methods**: name, signature, brief purpose
  - Comment on **complexity/architecture**

### 4. **Response Structuring**
- Collect all responses
- **Ensure JSON is clean and unified**, e.g.:

```json
{
  "overview": "...",
  "methods": [
    {"name": "saveFilm", "signature": "public void saveFilm(Film film)", "description": "Saves film details to DB"}
  ],
  "complexity": "Uses layered MVC with repository pattern"
}
```

### 5. **Output Aggregation**
- Merge all `overview`, `methods`, and `complexity` from multiple chunks
- Save as a single `knowledge_output.json` file

---

# 📋 Best Practices (as required in prompt)

| Principle | Implementation |
|:--|:--|
| **Token Efficiency** | Use a tokenizer (like `tiktoken`) to chunk large files properly |
| **Structured Output** | Prompt model to return **JSON only**, not prose |
| **Error Handling** | Fallback if response is invalid (retry, or log and skip) |
| **Scalability** | Code should handle many files across a project |
| **Reusability** | Prompt and logic should be abstract enough to apply to other codebases too |

---

# 🎁 Final Output Example (Simplified)

```json
{
  "overview": "This project manages a film rental system based on the Sakila DB.",
  "methods": [
    {
      "name": "getAllActors",
      "signature": "public List<Actor> getAllActors()",
      "description": "Fetches all actors from the database."
    }
  ],
  "complexity": "Uses a clean MVC pattern with Spring Boot and JPA repositories."
}
```

---

# ✅ Summary in One Line:

> The client wants a tool that **reads a GitHub Java project**, uses **LLM (like GPT-4)** to **extract understanding**, and outputs **structured, clean JSON** describing the project and its key logic.

Code Explanation




Great! Let's break this script down step by step and explain **what each block does**, **why it's there**, and **what improvements (if any) could be made**.

---

# 🧠 **Purpose of This Script**

This script:
- Reads a codebase (SakilaProject in this case)
- Splits the code into manageable chunks
- Uses OpenAI's GPT (via API) to analyze each chunk
- Extracts structured knowledge in JSON format:
  - Overview
  - Key methods (with signature and description)
  - Complexity notes
- Combines all outputs into a final `knowledge_output.json` file

---

# 🔍 Detailed Block-by-Block Breakdown

---

## ✅ 1. **Importing Libraries**
```python
import os
import json
import openai
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
```

### Why these are used:
- `os`: For file/directory traversal
- `json`: To write structured output
- `openai`: To call the OpenAI Chat API directly
- `langchain.llms.OpenAI`, `PromptTemplate`: **Imported but not used** (can be removed)

---

## ✅ 2. **Global Configuration**
```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = "OPEN AI API KEY"
CODEBASE_PATH = "./sakila_project"
OUTPUT_JSON = "knowledge_output.json"
CHUNK_SIZE = 3000
```

### Purpose:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Authenticates with OpenAI API
- `CODEBASE_PATH`: Directory containing the source code
- `OUTPUT_JSON`: Output file where structured knowledge will be saved
- `CHUNK_SIZE`: Maximum length (in characters) per chunk of code sent to OpenAI

> 🔴 **Note:** This should be **token-based**, not character-based, to avoid hitting GPT token limits.

---

## ✅ 3. **Set OpenAI Key**
```python
openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY
```
### Purpose:
- Authenticates your script with OpenAI services using the API key

> 🔴 **Security note:** Hardcoding the API key is risky. Better to use:  
```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

---

## ✅ 4. **Read Code Files**
```python
def read_code_files(CODEBASE_PATH):
    ...
```

### What this does:
- Walks through the folder structure
- Filters files by extension (`.py`, `.java`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.sql`)
- Reads file contents into a list of dicts:
```python
[{"path": ..., "content": ...}, ...]
```

### Why it’s useful:
- Prepares all files to be analyzed
- Keeps track of file origin with each chunk

---

## ✅ 5. **Chunking the Code**
```python
def chunk_code_files(code_files, chunk_size=CHUNK_SIZE):
    ...
```

### What it does:
- Aggregates code files into **chunks not exceeding 3000 characters**
- Uses a simple strategy: if adding a file exceeds the chunk limit → start a new chunk

### Why it's necessary:
- GPT models have token limits
- This avoids sending overly large inputs

> 🔴 **Note:** You should use **token counting** (`tiktoken` or `langchain`) for precision

---

## ✅ 6. **LLM Prompt + Call**
```python
def extract_knowledge_from_chunk(chunk):
    ...
```

### What it does:
- Creates a prompt for the LLM with the code chunk
- Tells GPT what to extract:
  - overview
  - methods (file, name, signature, description)
  - complexity_notes
- Calls `gpt-4o` via `openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)`

### Output Expected:
Structured JSON like:
```json
{
  "overview": "...",
  "methods": [{ "file": "...", "name": "...", "signature": "...", "description": "..." }],
  "complexity_notes": "..."
}
```

> 🔴 **Bug:** The prompt’s JSON format has incorrect syntax (`"overview: "` should be `"overview":`)

> ⚠️ No error handling here — if GPT returns bad JSON, the script will crash.

---

## ✅ 7. **Main Aggregation Logic**
```python
def main():
    ...
```

### What this does:
1. Reads code files
2. Chunks them
3. For each chunk:
   - Calls GPT
   - Appends the `overview`, `methods`, `complexity_notes` into aggregate lists
4. Joins all overviews into a single string
5. Combines all outputs into a single dictionary
6. Writes the result to `knowledge_output.json`

---

## ⚠️ 8. **Bug in Aggregation**
```python
agreegated["methods"].append(result["methods"])
```

This creates a **list of lists**.

✅ Should be:
```python
agreegated["methods"].extend(result["methods"])
```

---

# ✅ Final Output Structure
```json
{
  "overview": "Combined summary of all chunks...",
  "methods": [  // Flattened list of all method dicts ],
  "complexity_notes": [ "...", "...", ... ]
}
```

---

# 🔧 Suggested Improvements (Checklist)

| Issue | Fix |
|:---|:---|
| Prompt JSON format is broken | Fix syntax in the prompt |
| No error handling for GPT response | Use `try/except`, validate JSON |
| Token count by characters (inaccurate) | Use `tiktoken` to count actual tokens |
| Aggregation bug (list of lists) | Use `extend()` not `append()` |
| Hardcoded API key | Use `os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")` |
| LangChain imports unused | Remove `from langchain.llms import OpenAI` |
| No retry logic | Wrap API call with retry + logging for resilience |
| Save intermediate output | Save partial results every 5–10 chunks to prevent data loss |

---

# 🧠 Summary in One Sentence

> This script analyzes code chunks using GPT-4 to extract documentation-like insights (overview, methods, complexity) and compiles it into a single structured JSON output.
